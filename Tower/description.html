    <p> Bonjour! This project was inspired by the famous iron architectural structure in Paris -
      better known as the Eiffel Tower. The Eiffel Tower is placed in front of a sunset backdrop that
      can be controlled to set below the horizon. A twinkling lightshow follows the sunsetting
       to complete the experience.

    <h3 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-16">Eiffel Tower</h3>
    <p>The Eiffel Tower was implemented with lathe, box, sphere, cylinder, and wireframe geometries.
      To build the tower, programming was completed in stages corresponding with the upper, middle,
      and lower components of the landmark. The iconic structure of the Eiffel Tower was challenging
      to replicate because of its smooth curves yet rigid composition. A balance was achieved by combining
      traditional geometries with curved and unique polygons. The upper parts of the tower include a
      rectangular spire, segmented sphere dome, hexagonal platform, and central lathe wireframe. Code for the
      lathe geometries was adapted from our in-class
      <a href = "https://cs.wellesley.edu/~cs307/lectures/17-exercises/coke-better.html">example</a>.
      These materials were positioned and sized accordingly to mimic the dimensions of the tower. The lathe
      wireframe at the center of focus is created from two different Bezier curves each with four control points.
      As there is some repetition in the shape of the curved supports, this pattern was used throughout the design
      as seen in the shape of the legs. The center of the tower is made up of four legs and two supports – one
      wireframe and one solid box geometry. The legs are also lathe geometries, however, made with one Bezier
      curve and segmented by four to create the curving rectangular shape. The lower portion of the tower mimics
      the middle’s legs and supports with minor changes. The legs of the base had to be rotated in the x and z
      axis directions.
      Additionally, an arch support had be added between the gaps of every base support. This arch is a modified
      trapezoid with a quadratic curve base. In the final stage of the scene, after the sun sets, a lightshow
      on the tower occurs as is tradition in Paris. This animation is made from blocks of randomly positioned
      points that will either change their y position up or down in periods corresponding to the clock.
      Once their position of y reaches a certain threshold the animation stops, and the tower is left with its
      lights shining bright.
      The design of this animation was inspired by and adapted from our snow globe class
       <a href = "https://cs.wellesley.edu/~cs307/lectures/24-exercises/snowTown.html">example</a>.

    <h3 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-16">Sky</h3>
    <p>The background of the scene is mainly composed of the sky and a sun which sits to the left of the
      Eiffel Tower. This sky is adapted from the three.js example found here:
      <a href="https://threejs.org/examples/?q=sky#webgl_shaders_sky">Sky Shader</a> and
      <a href="https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/master/examples/webgl_shaders_sky.html">Sky Shader Code</a>.
      Adapting this code was quite difficult as we had to make sure that we had all the features that came in the code
      and also make sure the code is compatible with the rest of our code, especially when it came time to combine the background and the tower.
    <p>Our background went through four iterations of changes before we arrived at our final scene. The first iteration
      mainly consisted of the trying to adapt the code of the tower to the code for the shader.The second iteration was the animation of the sun.
      Our idea was to have the sun start in the left corner above the horizon and travel across
      the screen until it set. This iteration started off with the animation style that we saw in class. The style of the code
      was based off this example: <a href="https://cs.wellesley.edu/~cs307/lectures/13-exercises/moveCube.html"> Moving Cube</a>.
      However this did not work, so we tried to use a while loop that would remove the sun, adjust the position and rerender until
      the sun was below y = 5000. This attempt was the closest attempt as the console.log would print the y position of the sun
      which was shown to be decreasing and stopping once reaching 5000, yet the actual sun in the scene was not moving.
      <br>
      <img src="iter1.png" alt="iteration1" width=800px align="middle">
      <br>
      <p>So then we moved onto the third iteration. In this iteration, we went back to the original source code we adapted and
      created a gui control where the user can choose between three different types of day: noon, sunset, night. However,
      this was not the best way of creating the overall scene we had in mind.
      <br>
      Noon: <img src="iter2_noon.png" alt="noon" width = 800px><br><br>
      Sunset: <img src="iter2_sunset.png" alt="sunset" width = 800px><br><br>
      Night:<img src="iter2_night.png" alt="night" width = 800px><br><br>
    <p>Finally, on the fourth iteration, we were able to create the scene. We used the GUI features again and added if statements
      within the gui function to check for when the sun was below the horizon. Once the scene was dark, the lights would turn on.

      Sunset: <img src="iter3_middle.png" alt="middle" width = 800px><br><br>
      Night: <img src="iter3_after.png" alt="after" width = 800px><br><br>
