              <p>The idea behind our project was to explore vandalism across men's and women's pages. After reading studies that the majority of Wikipedia's editors are male, we were interested in seeing if women's pages faced more vandalism than men's pages. When we began exploring Wikipedia edits, we noticed that vandalism was generally quickly resolved through highly active users and bots. When fixing vandalism, these users either tagged their edits as "vandalism" or used the word "vandalism" in the comments of their edit. So, we decided to explore the pages of men and women to find if one group did in fact have a higher number of edits relating to vandalism.</p>

              <div class="subheading mb-3">Initial Data Exploration</div>
              <p>
                In the prelimiary stages of data collection, we focused our attention on the top male and female athletes from the same sport. We wanted to measure differences in the frequency of edits to see if there was link in terms of their gender and edit activity. After concluding that the number of edits was highly dependant on time of fame and centered around breakout performances, we realized that our study wouldn't be feasible for athletes. Further, we realized that male athletes in general were getting more edits, and so the number of vandalisms was skewed by this differences. In order to fix this problem and still keep our initial research question, we shifted our focus to the top paid actors and actresses of 2017. We wanted to see if celebrities got more vandalism on their pages than the average Wikipedia page and if there was a difference in vandalism for celebrities by gender.

          <p>
              
              To test our hypotheses, we complied a list of top paid male and female actors and actresses in 2017. We chose to use the top paid professionals in the same field as a way to level their fame and use a metric that could be physically measured, like salary. We then ran tests to see which pages had more occurrances of vandalism. As a control group, we randomly selected 1000 Wikipedia pages to compare to our test groups of male and female celebrity actors. We compared the amounts of vandalism on these male and female actor's pages to the control group and to each other. We were aware that famous men and women were likely to be more controversial and draw in more editors. With this increased controversy comes increased traffic on their pages, which we believe allows for a wider audience of editors to comment as well as haters to vandalize. The results helped us understand how women and men may be targeted or subject to abuse on the internet. </li>

          <div class="subheading mb-3">Data Extraction</div>
              <p>Using Python, we extracted the edits from 1000 random pages, 10 famous actors, and 10 famous actresses Wikipedia pages. We parsed through these edits to find a vandalism tag or references to vandalism in the edits, and kept track of such edits. The overall data extraction process can be seen in the <a href="Random_Vandalisms.html">Control Group Notebook</a> and <a href="Wikipedia_Vandalisms.html">Test Group Notebook</a>.

            Next, we ran appropriate statistical tests in order to make sense of the data we had collected. First, we ran a one-sample, two-tailed t-test on the men's data against our population mean and the women's data against our population mean at an alpha cutoff of 0.01. For these two tests, the null hypothesis was that the number of vandalisms on our sample data would be the same as the number of vandalisms on the population of Wikipedia pages. Note that our population mean was calculated using the data collected from randomly generated Wikipedia pages. Because the p-value for the men's sample data did not fall within our alpha cutoff range, we failed to reject our null hypothesis. However, the p-value for the women's sample data was less than the alpha value, so we rejected our null hypothesis that the amount of vandalism on women's pages was equal to the amount of vandalism on men's pages.

          <p class="mb-0"> 
            For our final t-test, we ran a two-sample, one-tailed t-test comparing the women's data to the men's data. Here, our null hypothesis was that women would not have more vandalism than men, and our alternate hypothesis was that women would have more vandalism than men. We tested this at an alpha value of 0.05. Because our p-value is less than the alpha value, we rejected our null hypothesis. A more detailed analysis and breakdown of the statistical tests we ran can be viewed in this <a href="Wiki_Statistical_Analysis.html">Statistical Analysis Notebook</a>.

          <p> 
            It was interesting to see that our experiment showed that we were on track with our gut-feeling about gendered differences in vandalism on Wikipedia pages. However, due to the small sample size and nature of this study, it should really be used as a preliminary study to further explore vandalism. It would be interesting to repeat our study with a larger sample set of data, and consider differences across industry. Instead of just looking at tags, we could look into the "vandal" edits to see if the edits are primarily random acts of vandalism like large-scale deletes and random keyboard strokes, or tailored acts of vandalism such as derogatory terms and false information. 
          </p>

          <p>
            It is also important to point out that our study specifically changed the paramters of our t-tests to show a concrete example in the phenomenon of "p-hacking". If you look in our results section, when we compared men's edits and women's edits to the control group, we ran a two-tailed t test with an alpha cutoff of 0.01. This is extremely stringent, and is following the minimum values imposed by selective, prestigious scientific journals like "Cell" or "Nature". In our two-sample t-test, however, we changed the alpha cutoff to 0.05 and modified our test to a 1-tailed t-test. You can see how this affects the statistical test in the graph below. A 1-tailed t-test only looks at one side of the data (left or right), so we can divide our p-value by 2. By doing this, and adjusting our alpha value to 0.05, we were able to get statisically significant results that proved our hypothesis that there is a difference between vandalism in men's and women's pages correct. Had we kept our t-test to two-tailed or an alpha cutoff of 0.01, we would have gotten a p-value of around 0.07 and would have had to accept our null hypothesis. This shows how easy it is to "fudge" scientific results and get "fraudelent" results in a seemingly innocuous way.
