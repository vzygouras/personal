            <p> Find my final project page <a href="finalwebpage/index.html">here</a>.  
            </p> 


            <h2 class="section-heading">12/19/17: Project Work</h2>
          
            <p>  Estimated Time to Complete: 6 hours </p>

            <p> Today I saved all of my notebooks as HTML files and learned how to embed plotly graphs that I had created into my final project webpage. I’m adding all of the text and creating my report page which is taking a lot of time. I’m also running all of my notebooks to make sure that when I submit them they run without errors and they have documentation.  </p>


             <h2 class="section-heading">12/15/17: Project Work</h2>
          
            <p>  Estimated Time to Complete: 8 hours </p>

            <p> Today I've been reading through the notebooks I have completed so far and cleaning any unnecessarily messy code and reformatting my dataframes in ways that look better. This will also help my future steps when I need to load the data from files especially for my classifier which I still need to work out some issues for. I am getting results for my email content classification but they are very small and it seems like my data isn't formatted in a way it likes. I also started my statistical analysis/hypothesis testing notebook and have included lots of visualizations from plotly and matplotlib. </p>

             <h2 class="section-heading">12/13/17: Project Work</h2>
          
            <p>  Estimated Time to Complete: 2 hours </p>

            <p> Today I went to Eni’s office hours where I learned what the values of the matrix really mean after the “classifier.predict_proba(case)” call which was interesting to see that my classifier was confused by my test data which is exactly what I wanted to show! I also learned that for my second classifier for the content of my emails I was getting errors because the X values and y values of the matrix were very different sizes which prohibits the vectorizer from working properly.</p>


            <h2 class="section-heading">12/12/17: Project Work</h2>
          
            <p>  Estimated Time to Complete: 4 hours </p>
            <p> I'm trying to work through the issues with my classifier and formatting the data. One of the issues I’ve ran into is the spacing of email lines when you write them to files/read them out. I’ve been getting some errors that I realized are from the formatting of my data/the presence of certain Unicode characters that the vectorizer cant work with so I had to loop through my data and try to detect and “ignore” the unicode function which helped my code run with less errors. </p> 


            <h2 class="section-heading">12/11/17: Project Work</h2>
          
            <p>  Estimated Time to Complete: 4 hours </p>
            <p> My focus for right now is to try to build two text classifiers for the subjects of my emails as well as the content of them. I’m studying the Week 14 notebook on visualization to help me understand Sklearn and the ways that the data needs to be formatted in the matrix to make all of the functions work. Before I could even get to the classification step I had to modify my data from the exploration notebook and download the dataframes contents into text files which I could then access from different notebooks. 
            </p> 

             <h2 class="section-heading">12/11/17: Hypothesis Testing Notebook</h2>
          
            <p>  Estimated Time to Complete: 1 hour</p>

            <p> The visualizations with seabourne were really helpful in this notebook and I encorporated similar graphing models in my notebook for statistical analysis. </p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">12/11/17: Text Classification Notebook</h2>
          
            <p>  Estimated Time to Complete: 1 hour</p>

            <p> I found this <a href="week14-textclassification.html">notebook</a> very helpful while I've been building similar classifiers for my Digital Natives Project. I like the way this classifier is able to sort through the data with vectors and how it automatically generates probability figures for each of the features. </p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">12/9/17: Project Work</h2>
          
            <p>  Estimated Time to Complete: 3 hours</p>
            <p> Today I worked on collecting the data from my emails. I found the notebook that Eni shared for inbox analysis to be very helpful especially when trying to separate the content of my emails from a lot of the HTML “junk” that comes along with each message. My goal for these data exploration notebooks are try to format the data in a way that is easily understood and has all of the information necessary for me to move forward with my analysis. </p> 

            <h2 class="section-heading">12/8/17: Project Work</h2>
          
            <p>  Estimated Time to Complete: 8 hours </p>
            <p> I’m still in the data collection phase of my project but I am making progress on visualizations of my Gmail browser history. I found this part of the data exploration phase to take the longest so far. I’ve had some issues converting my time stamps in the dataframe in a way that a Series will be compatible with so that I can graph those values. The code for these visualizations may be a bit awkward and long-winded but mainly because of the limited time I have to complete everything that I want to get done. </p> 



            <h2 class="section-heading">12/7/17: Project Work</h2>
          
            <p>  Estimated Time to Complete: 5 hours </p>
            <p> For my project I’m first starting with the data collection for both of my sources of information: my browser and my email inbox. I’m starting with my browser due to familiarity with SQL and creating browser dataframes from the second Google project. In the data exploration notebook for my browser history I focus on the amount of times I access gmail from my Wellesley account. Since browser history only saves from about three months past from the present I’m not able to get the data for the amount of times that I access my other younger gmail accounts so this notebook will be very focused. I plan to space out the work so that one day I can focus on purely stripping the data and the next I can try to manipulate it and create visualizations. </p> 





         


            <h2 class="section-heading">12/5/17: Final Project Plan</h2>
          
            <p>  Estimated Time to Complete: 30 minutes </p>
            <p> In the final project my goal is to parse through emails from the three main email accounts in my life so far. Each of the accounts represents a different phase of my digital native experience. I will explore different questions like: How comfortable have I felt emailing professors overtime?, What types of companies have I subscribed to in the past and how has that changed?, and do I write longer emails now or shorter emails? I also plan to look at my browser history to see how often I check my email and how long it takes me to reply to emails. I hope through this project that I will be able to learn interesting habits or trends I have picked up through my digital native experience so far. 




          <h2 class="section-heading">12/4/17: Digital Natives Class Discussion</h2>
          
            <p>  Estimated Time to Complete: 30 minutes </p>
            <p> During our in class discussion we identified social and economic issues surrounding the narrative of digital natives and what makes someone skilled technically and as well as what can inhibit techincal personal progress. Hargittai used statistical analysis and linear regressions to model her data. In the models specific to regression the positive and negative values correspond to how certain activites are related to using the internet for informational purposes.</p>

            <p>
              To determine what makes one a “digital native” I’m especially curious to collect data on the relationship between time spent on different types of digital devices as opposed to just a laptop or desktop computer as the articles were mainly focused on. As my generation was one of the first to experience the smartphone boom I wonder if that extra practice and constant attachment to our phones is related to how well some may match the description of what it means to be a digital native. I can remember as early as fifth grade some of my classmates had iphones or similar Samsung and LG touchscreen devices that could access the internet and run other simple games. Although the article brought up an interesting point that some may use devices for more productive purposes than others I think that glosses over the fact that those who may not look up stock options on their phone could still navigate the interface well enough that if they were to ever choose to they could access that information as opposed to a digital immigrant who may not even be able to walk through the steps and button sequences. Data for time spent on an iphone is easily accessible through settings and even a breakdown of the apps most used is provided. Other interesting factors could be at what age someone first got their smart phone.
