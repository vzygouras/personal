              To determine what makes one a “digital native” I’m especially curious to collect data on the relationship between time spent on different types of digital devices as opposed to just a laptop or desktop computer as the articles were mainly focused on. As my generation was one of the first to experience the smartphone boom I wonder if that extra practice and constant attachment to our phones is related to how well some may match the description of what it means to be a digital native. I can remember as early as fifth grade some of my classmates had iphones or similar Samsung and LG touchscreen devices that could access the internet and run other simple games. Although the article brought up an interesting point that some may use devices for more productive purposes than others I think that glosses over the fact that those who may not look up stock options on their phone could still navigate the interface well enough that if they were to ever choose to they could access that information as opposed to a digital immigrant who may not even be able to walk through the steps and button sequences. Data for time spent on an iphone is easily accessible through settings and even a breakdown of the apps most used is provided. Other interesting factors could be at what age someone first got their smart phone.
