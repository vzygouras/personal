              <p>Researchers have coined the terms digital-native and digital-immigrant as a way to classify and distinguish those who have grown up surrounded by technology and those who were exposed to this new medium later in their life. There are many misconceptions surrounding the correlation between age and technical advancement, with the assumption being that if a person is younger they are destined to be better at navigating technology than someone who is older. Hargittai summarizes this well in her own research, “people who have grown up with digital media are often assumed to be universally savvy with information and communication technologies” (“Digital Na(t)ives? Variation in Internet Skills and Uses among Members of the ‘‘Net Generation’’) however this is not necessarily the case as many factors such as socioeconomic status greatly affect the access to and ownership of devices like laptops and cellphones which foster the skills that a digital native may possess. For my purposes I am going to assume that I am a digital native due to my age and frequent exposure to tech devices throughout my life. My goal is to explore how to measure my personal progress as a digital native by analyzing traces from my personal data sets.

              <div class="subheading mb-3">My focus</div>
              <p>
                I plan to measure my growth in a number of ways by detecting patterns in the data collected from my Google Chrome Browser History as well as three Gmail Accounts I have had throughout my digital native life. I made my first Gmail account when I was about 12 years old and named it vz.gym.lax@gmail.com. Realizing while I was in high school that I needed an email account a bit more sophisticated I created viki.zygouras@gmail.com around the age of 16. Finally, once I got to college I was given my Wellesley Gmail account, vzygoura@wellesley.edu, which correlates to my age now 20. Over the past 8 years of Gmail use I plan to track my personal progress as an email writer. Through my chrome history I focus on traces between the browser and my Wellesley Gmail account. Both of these databases will help me answer underlying questions about my status as a digital native and the opportunity for change in the form of growth overtime.

              To collect data from my browser I downloaded the History file from chrome that saves all browser activity for the past three or so months. With certain programming libraries I was able to easily input the traces into data tables with information that would be useful for later processing like the URL, webpage title, time of visit, visit count, and the visit duration. This project is focused primarily on Gmail so I filtered through my browser history to find all activity that was related to my Wellesley College Gmail Account. By only looking at my Gmail activity through the browser, information like how many times I check my emails and at what times of the day/week/month become available. An example of the data I can collect is below of my Gmail use by hour according to the browser history. After formatting and focusing my data on relevant information I could easily proceed to the data exploration step of the data science cycle. Actions performed in the data collection step can be seen in this browser <a href="data+collection+and+exploration-browser.html"> Data Collection Notebook</a>. </li>

          <div class="subheading mb-3">Email Inboxes:</div>
              <p> With Google Takeout, a program that allows users to download their mail and other google product information, I was able to obtain all of the data from each of my three Gmail accounts. With the help of Python’s library developed to handle Email inboxes I was able to organize, filter through, and clean the data that would be relevant to my uses. I was able to find the total number of emails for each inbox as well as the content of specific messages I have received and sent. While filtering through the data, I made the decision to exclude any mail that was not a direct communication sent by me. This includes mail that did not have a body of text or was simply a file transfer that would not be useful to exploring my hypotheses of personal growth through my written emails. For each sent email I primarily focused on the subjects and their contents without HTML tags. I made a table for the emails that I sent for each of my accounts with information like who the email was sent to, the date, the subject and content’s lengths as well as information related to emails in a thread. I saved my data to csv files as well as text files for future work in this email <a href="data+collection-wellesley-emails.html"> Data Collection Notebook</a>.

            Through data exploration more information can be found about patterns and trends in my data. I discovered that my Wellesley Gmail inbox is the most visited Gmail URL with 801 visits. This means that in the past three or so months I have checked/refreshed my inbox 801 times as I am frequently checking my mail during the semester. My email use is also consistent with my work as a student. I use Gmail the most during weekdays as opposed to weekends when I don’t have class. The visualization of my use by day can be seen below obtained by sorting my inbox data by the visit time and then by days in the week. On average I check my Email 545 times a month and the difference between months can be seen in the bar graph below. October is the height of the semester and often when my inbox use would be the highest with midterms beginning and the semester becoming more intense as opposed to September and November. The sharp drop in November can be attributed to Thanksgiving break as well as the semester winding down before finals period and the last few weeks of class. The figures above also display other time metrics used in the exploration like hour of the day I’m using Gmail the most and the use by week in the semester. The Exploration notebook can be found in the data collection notebook for the browser above.

          <p> Exploring my Gmail data in this <a href="data+exploration-emails.html"> Exploration Notebook</a> allowed me to draw comparisons and differences between my three accounts and to have a sense of how my usage as a Gmail user has developed overtime. I loaded in the data from the previous data collection notebook and then extracted information concerning the Date variable which tracks the year/month/day/time I sent an email. I was able to fit the timelines of usage from all of the accounts below on the range slider visualization. There are some overlaps in the timelines wherever there are lines that cross into the same time period. This is due to the fact that while I try not to actively use my accounts I may be forced to reply to certain threads or people who contact me through older accounts. I could also track how often I send emails by days of the week for each of the three accounts which can be seen in the three pie charts below. As found with the Gmail browser history I am least frequently sending emails on the weekends as opposed to weekdays.

             <div class="subheading mb-3">Hypothesis Testing</div> 

            <p>With the use of <a href="hypothesis+testing.html"> statistical analysis</a>, I could prove my hypotheses above depending on the results of certain tests. While performing statistical analysis, I tested hypotheses 1,2, and 3 which are related to the lengths of my email subjects, content, and threads across my Gmail accounts. I predicted that the length of the content and subject of my emails will increase overtime so the null hypothesis would be that the figures are consistent overtime. The subjects of my first, middle, and last account’s sent email mean length was 14, 19, and 24 characters respectively. Thus, there was a steady growth in the average length of my email subjects but to prove they were statistically significant I ran a two-sample t-test with the mean of subject lengths for my oldest account and youngest account yielding a p-value that was less than 0.05 so I could reject the null hypothesis that my subject lengths did not change overtime. I ran similar tests to see if the difference between the content length of my oldest account and newest account were different with my oldest account having an average length of 2,772 characters and the newest account having 1,011 characters which is obvious that my email lengths did not increase overtime but rather shortened by more than 200% and the two-sample t-test affirmed this with a p-value of .014. Lastly, the average length of my email threads for each account was 1.14, 1.10, and 1.32 which does not vary much as expected.</p>

<div class="subheading mb-3">Classification</div> 


<p> In order to track my linguistic progress throughout the years I built two classifiers focused on the text in my <a href="email+classification-+headers.html"> subjects</a> and the text in the <a href="email+classification-content.html"> contents</a> of emails. I imported text files of every emails contents and the subject lines to use as input for the vectorizer after ensuring that the data samples from each account were the same size. The labels I used were viki12, viki16, and viki20 which correspond to one email account and also my age when that account was most active to me. Both classifiers followed the same format of inputted labels and respective text information which the count vectorizer used to determined features. I created test cases for each notebook as text that was new to the classifier to see how well it could predict which version of myself had written the email. The classifier handling my email contents incorrectly labeled 2/3 of my test cases meaning there must not have been a great distinction between the language used in each of my accounts. The same pattern followed for the classification of my email headers where the classifier’s predictions were often split evenly across each feature. For one test case from my viki12 account each feature was given the same probability of 0.333 which means that my text across all three accounts had an equal chance. </p>

          <p> 
            
          <p> The methods above conclude: </p>
          <p>1. The length of my email subjects have increased overtime.</p>
          <p>2. The length of my email contents have decreased overtime.</p>
          <p>3. The length of my email threads have stayed relatively the same. </p>
          <p>4. I do in fact check my Wellesley Email account and my previous accounts more during the weekdays than the weekends.  </p>
          <p>5. My style of writing has stayed consistent overtime. </p>
          </p>

          <p> My progress as a digital native in terms of email use is directly linked to my work as a student. I am constantly checking my email accounts at peak times of the semester and then less frequently while away from school. While the length of my email contents did not increase overtime, the subjects did which indicates more descriptive titles for my emails. The drop in email content could be attributed to the fact that my younger email accounts were sometimes used as an instant messanger between my friends and I before we all had our own cellphones to use which may not indicate my progress as an email writer but I think it shows that I shift and adapt to new technologies when they become accessible. My email threads and language used in emails remaining consistent show that my email writing style has stayed fairly the same as well as use. I did not expect the email thread size to increase overtime as I primarily use email threads to communicate to professors as opposed to my classmates who I can instantly message or text. My results show that as a digitial native I am able to adapt to the new uses of different devices like cell phones as well as maintain knowledge and skills of older tools like Email. </p>
